While our app does not target any specific type of user, our design generally is most favorable for the plant enthusiasts with any experience. With little to no experience, specifically any beginners to gardening and those who would like to own plants and take care of them. This is further categorized into students, novice gardeners, and household plant owners. 
In general households, family members can use the app to understand the responsibilities of owning plants. The parents of younger family members could be both the stakeholder and the users. As a stakeholder, they would want their kids to use the app as a teaching opportunity, for instance teaching the responsibility of ownership. The impact of this app on the parents is that it would make it easier, manageable, and fun to teach their kids. As users both the kids and the parents would have little to none experience and could learn together through the app.
In a school place, our app can be utilized by students in terms of studying the nature of growing plants. In this case, the stakeholders would be the institutions and the instructors that provide courses that may integrate this app for related plant studies. This app would motivate students to learn, which would impact the institution and Instructors. Instructors should already have the background knowledge to support the app information. Students would be less experienced, however, they should be able to learn quickly from our application.   
The more experienced users can use this app to further assist their daily activities which can be impactful in productivity.
Gardeners can apply information displayed on our app for optimal growth in their garden. Plantmen can use the encyclopedia functionality of our app to discover more plants that they may love to incorporate in their garden.
A botanist can use the app in their research to make some process faster which would be convenient.

#IDEO Methods:
1. Survery and Question

When building an application involving user interaction, one of the best ways to start research is to get user data through surveys and questionnaires. Our team designed a Google Docs user survey, which covered topics like daily life, plant-caring, and experience with mobile and AR technologies. We focused on building a technology that is catered towards people of a younger demographic yet appealing enough such that people of older demographics won’t be turned off by its look-and-feel being traditionally child-centered or cartoon-like. With that being said, we recommended all individuals taking the survey to attempt stepping into the shoes of a 10-year-old child, precisely when they were being asked about app- and plant-related questions. When we analyzed our results, we focused on two main categories - people 24 and under (younger youth) compared to people above 24 (older youth), to people past 50 for the more 'experienced' or 'mature' set of users. 

Overall, almost everyone who took the survey acknowledged that they own plants or have taken care of plants before. Analyzing answers from the younger to older youth demographics on questions about mobile games and amount of time spent on various activities in life, we were not surprised to find a gradual increase in “busyness” with age. Youth had significantly more time for their hobbies whereas older youth and individuals from the 'mature' set were shown to have little time for leisure (including time spent on mobile devices). One surprising factor was that, when asked their favourite mobile game, many people in the early-youth group selected ‘Pokémon Go’ as their choice, whereas individuals in the older youth group went for games like “Minecraft” or “Among Us.” In the most mature demographic, more mundane games like “Candy Crush” started to appear. It seems that late youth face increased gaming expectations, sicne most (despite being busier than the younger youth) would choose to play a game that requires investing a consecutive chunk of time into it. For example, whereas a game like Candy Crush or Pokémon Go are on-the-run games, a game like Minecraft would have sessions that could go for 30 minutes up to a few hours.

Another good thing to notice was the separation between wanting straightforward explanation/instructions amongst the younger crowd and the shift towards straight-forward/both to a full detailed-oriented description amongst the mature group. Comparatively, almost everyone liked the idea of graphical assistance and the concept of product recommendations. 

When talking about plants, most people found themselves in the “alright-to-tough” range in terms of fully managing a plant. No one  seemed to have trouble with the task of watering itself; however, especially amongst the younger crowd, there was frustration on when to water and how much at a time. Other issues in both youth and meture groups included fertilizing and other various planting caring techniques, however it would appear that younger people found it harder to “learn how to take care of a plan” versus “remembering how to take care of a plant.” This, in turn, matched up well with the youth wanting a step-by-step guide feature compared to the more in-depth “why is my plant dying” feature that the mature group wanted. 

2. Shadowing

Using the “Look” method of shadowing, we decided to follow one of our family members throughout their daily routine along with analyzing those specific moments they had; attending to their plants. From this information, we were able to find some common issues with regards to plant caring. For most, it seemed like a love-hate relationship. The wanting to nourish and take good care of the plant, however feeling as though it’s a chore to do so. ‘How much water does it need? Did I remember to water it at all?’ 

Other occurrences ranging from: leaves falling, color change, or unprecedented dehydration. All of these issues result in spending more time on the internet searching for a solution. It’s time consuming whereas they could be doing something else. 


3. Error Analysis 

It’s important to take note of all the potential ways a design would go south. When we were conducting our research, we already anticipated how a few things would go unplanned or may arise as an issue as time went on. Many software related issues could headaches such as; 

-	The plant doesn’t get scanner in properly 
-	The app recommends the wrong product (fertilizer, soil, etc.) 
-	The UI is slow and unoptimized 
-	The production transaction/order fails or doesn’t work properly (Assuming this function is still provided) 

After reflexing from the results from our sent-out survey, and shadowing sessions. We have also been able to determine some potential way in which our design would produce a negative user experience;

-	The app ends up being too “simplistic” or becomes a “cartoonish”-annoyance, making it unappealing to a mature demographic. In reverse, it becomes too serious such that is does not seems intuitive for younger people.
-	The UI is too messy to navigate through and it comes tedious or unappealing. 
-	The product suggestions are unrelatable or non-convincing.
