#IDEO Methods:
1. Survery and Question

If you plan on building an application that involves user-interaction, then one of the best ways to start your research is to start grabbing user data through questionnaires and surveys. Our team designed a Google Doc survey converting different topics with regards to things such as, daily-life, plant-carrying, and question with regards to mobile and AR technologies. Due to the nature of our project, that being; we were mainly focusing on building a device which can be catered towards people of a younger demographic but be appealing enough such that people of older demographics won’t be turned-off by its traditional child/cartoon-like nature. With that being said, we recommended all individual who took the survey to try and step into the shoes of a child, precisely when they were being asked about app and plant-related questions. Additionally, when we were analyzing our results, we focused on two main categories; people who were ranging from 24 and under (to cover a predominantly young and ‘innocent’ group) in comparison to people who were above 24 and or reaching past 50+ for a more ‘experienced’ and mature set. 

Universally, just about everyone who conducted the survey acknowledged that they have plants or have taken care of plants at some point. When the younger demographic was asked about topics such as mobile games and the time they spend on various tasks in their daily life, it was no surprise to find a gradually increase in “busyness.” Youth had significantly more time in doing their hobbies whereas older youth and individuals from the ‘mature’-set were shown to have little time for leisure (this includes time spent on mobile devices). One surprisingly factor was that when asked about what was one mobile-game that each of them enjoyed, many people in the early-youth selected ‘Pokémon Go’ as their choice, while others in the older youth went for things like “Minecraft” or “Among Us.” As the demographic went even older, more mundane games like “Candy Crush” started to appear. There is a rise in the expectations for late youth as it appears that most (despite being busier than the much younger youth) would pretty to play game where they have to “invest time” into. Whereas a game like Candy Crush or Pokémon Go are on-the-run games, a game like Minecraft would have sessions that could go for 30 minutes up to a few hours.  

Another good thing to notice was the separation between wanting straightforward explanation/instructions amongst the younger crowd and the shift towards straightforward/both to a full detailed-oriented description amongst the mature group. Just about everyone liked the idea of graphical assistance and the concept of having production recommendations. 

Then talking about plants, most people found themselves in a ranger form “alright-to-tough” in terms of fully managing a plant. No one really seemed to have trouble with watering the plant itself however especially amongst the younger crowd was a frustration on when to do the watering and how much at a time. Other issues in both groups included fertilizing and other various planting caring techniques, however it would appear that while younger people found it harder to “learn how to take care of a plan” versus “remembering how to take care of a plant.” Which in return matched up pretty well with the youth wanted a step-by-step feature in comparison to the more in depth “Why is my plant dying” feature that the mature group wanted. 

2. Shadowing

Using the “Look” method of shadowing, we decided to follow one of our family members throughout their daily routine along with analyzing those specific moments they had; attending to their plants. From this information, we were able to find some common issues with regards to plant caring. For most, it seemed like a love-hate relationship. The wanting to nourish and take good care of the plant, however feeling as though it’s a chore to do so. ‘How much water does it need? Did I remember to water it at all?’ 

Other occurrences ranging from: leaves falling, color change, or unprecedented dehydration. All of these issues result in spending more time on the internet searching for a solution. It’s time consuming whereas they could be doing something else. 


3. Error Analysis 

It’s important to take note of all the potential ways a design would go south. When we were conducting our research, we already anticipated how a few things would go unplanned or may arise as an issue as time went on. Many software related issues could headaches such as; 

-	The plant doesn’t get scanner in properly 
-	The app recommends the wrong product (fertilizer, soil, etc.) 
-	The UI is slow and unoptimized 
-	The production transaction/order fails or doesn’t work properly (Assuming this function is still provided) 

After reflexing from the results from our sent-out survey, and shadowing sessions. We have also been able to determine some potential way in which our design would produce a negative user experience;

-	The app ends up being too “simplistic” or becomes a “cartoonish”-annoyance, making it unappealing to a mature demographic. In reverse, it becomes too serious such that is does not seems intuitive for younger people.
-	The UI is too messy to navigate through and it comes tedious or unappealing. 
-	The product suggestions are unrelatable or non-convincing.
