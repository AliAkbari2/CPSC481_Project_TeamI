Idea-01: Universal Gamer Watch Index

Problem and service;
A universal gamer index is a design pointed at keeping tract of gamers from different platforms, more specifically gamers who are troubled/being “toxic.” The internet is a 
common environment of anonymity and therefore many individuals feel that they have reason to act however they wish no matter how rude or offensive seeming that there is little 
consequence for their actions. 

Importance; 
To maintain a healthy society, one must not only look upon public offenders but also those who take it to the web. Many individuals who may appear to be common or genuine on the 
outside may contain a dark personal in which they use on the internet. People such the naively innocent, particularly when it comes to younger electronic users could easily be 
swayed by the opinions around them. This could lead to cyberbullying, or the allowing individuals to be indulged into potential hate-groups should there be one involved. 

Concept and Distribution; 
The idea is to have a site which monitors those who are on an “offense”-list.  To get one on the list, once an individual has committed enough “toxic”-acts, or if they opt for a 
more offensive act (direct obvious cyberbullying or attempts of or recruiting into a “hate-crime.”). One would have to submit an evidence piece to the website, and upon extensive 
investigation would determine if the individual is qualified to be tracked on the website. If approved, they will be notified the console service (Xbox, PS4, Switch, etc.) or the 
game distribution service (Steam, Origin, UPlay, etc.) if on PC, where they would use a tracking filter to keep tabs on what the users says to others (More specifically a 
text-filter.) Anything continuous offenses will be record on the website. However, through a period, if the user stops committing bad-acts they could potentially be discharged 
from being monitored, however the website would keep them on record, but with a noticed that they are no longer being tracked.  

The website will feature separate colors theme depending on the medium/console they choose, a universal theme would also be provided should the interacting-user choose to. 
There website currently would likely have three categories (tabs). One featuring a direct database which container all the users on the blacklist, upon clicking on them would 
prompt their on-site profile with various details such as how many bad-acts they committed what was the act that got them onto the page, and if they are still being monitored. 
The second category would be a specific filter, dedicated to specific acts which would then each different show a smaller database containing a list of offenders who commit
said-act; taking the interacting-user to an evidence page, which could also lead directly to the user’s blacklist profile page. The last category would be dedicated for 
submissions for potential offenses. This website could also have a mobile-friendly version.
